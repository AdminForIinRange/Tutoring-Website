### Tutor Landing Page

This project is a dynamic and visually appealing landing page for a tutoring service, developed as a personal project to explore new technologies and enhance my skills. Driven by a passion for learning and innovation, I experimented with Tailwind CSS and Chakra UI to create an engaging user experience with great UI/UX design.

The landing page aims to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users seeking tutoring services. It showcases the offerings, features, and benefits of the tutoring service in an attractive and user-friendly manner.
